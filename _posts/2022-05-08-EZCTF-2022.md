# Introduction

- This CTF was 24 hours on May 6th and May 7th. Pretty basic stuff but I only did web exploitation and the others are too CTF specific and just puzzle so I didn't bother. 

- Fun experience otherwise :)

# Forensics 
## DigitalOcean (50 points)
- The flag is in the slide, not hidden or anything.
- `EZ-CTF{TH1S_1S_FR33}`

# Web 
## Super Secure (100 points)
- http://ez.ctf.cafe:8888
- Try `OR 1=1'` it returns a SQL Error. So the form is susceptible to SQLi.
- I tried running SQLMap but it does not yield immediate result.
- I browse to `PayLoadAllTheThing` GitHub and use this payload `' or 1=1 limit 1 -- -+`.
- `EZ-CTF{N0t_S0_S4f3_4ft3r_411}`

## I made a blog! (150 points)
- http://ez.ctf.cafe:9999
- The site is vulnerable to LFI: `http://ez.ctf.cafe:9999/blog-posts.php?file=../../../../../etc/passwd`
- Running `dirsearch` we see interesting results such as `/robots.txt`, `/flag.php`.
- `flag.php`: How do you filter your coffee?
- I tried a couple more LFI to RCE but not working.
- This guide helped me a lot: https://d00mfist.gitbooks.io/ctf/content/local_file_inclusion.html
- In order to show the content of `flag.php`, I used the payload: `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=flag.php`
- `EZ-CTF{LFI_1S_3Z}`

## Race 1 (200 points) & Race 2 (300 points)
- Sadly someone DDOS the 2 challenges. The organizer decided to give out the flag for everyone. Kudos to them and big L to the one ruining the fun.
- `EZ-CTF{R3C_T0_34SY_F0R_M3}`
- `EZ-CTF{1_4M_PR3TTY_G00D_4T_R3C}`
